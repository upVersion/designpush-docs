description: How to access the DesignPush beta, what to expect, and how to report issues.
---

DesignPush is currently in beta. You can access the app at **<a href="https://beta.designpush.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beta.designpush.app</a>**.

---

## What's included in the beta

- Full design token editor — primitive, semantic, and component token layers
- Live component preview panel
- Font management with Google Fonts integration
- AI-assisted workflow for token generation
- Export to CSS, SCSS, JS, TS, and JSON (DTCG format)
- Figma plugin for importing tokens as native variables and styles ([see docs](/reference/figma-plugin/))

## Known limitations

- Some features are behind feature flags and may not yet be available (e.g. Tailwind CSS preset export)
- User sign-in and account management is currently in development. During beta, accessing your design system is via your browser profile. Access to your design system will persist across sessions unless browser cache is cleared. To test or generate additional design systems, use a different browser, different browser profile or incognito/private window
- Component editing is currently limited to a selection of core components. Additional components will be added throughout the beta phase up to launch. Check back regularly for updates

## Reporting issues

If you find a bug or have feedback:

- Note what you were doing when the issue occurred
- Include your browser and OS
- Screenshots or screen recordings are helpful
- Share any console errors if visible (open with F12 or Cmd+Option+I)

In the app, the user panel (bottom-left) contains a bug report button to submit a report directly.
